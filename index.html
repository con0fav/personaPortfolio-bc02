                    <p>Connor Favero is working very hard to become a web developer. 
                        He is always looking for ways to make code cleaner, more readable, and more efficient. 
                        He's very new to most everything but he understands computers are stupid and will only do exactly what they are told. In his free time he is a music producer and composer, trying to make the most of a hectic work and school schedule. </p>
                    <p> Placeholder text: Concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution you might wanna give it another shot can you make it look like this clipart i found could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room?. I'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand we are a big name to have in your portfolio, for will royalties in the company do instead of cash, I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much. Can you make it faster?. Anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do just do what you think. I trust you this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please, remember, everything is the same or better. Can you make it look more designed can you please send me the design specs again?  </p>
